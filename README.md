I mainly leveraged pandas to complete data validation and cleaning, then utilized SQL to conduct exploratory data analysis to determine top-performing categories and products. Furthermore, hypothesis testing is conducted to confirm statistical significance of the findings along with practical significance of the data.

Leveraging SQLAlchemy and Pandas, I connected to a MySQL database and analyzed multiple employee attrition factors and utilized Matplotlib to visualiz key insights, enabling HR teams to make informed decisions regarding employee retention strategies based on reliable and accurate data. |

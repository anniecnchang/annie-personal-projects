**Data Analysis:**

1. [Employee Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/anniecnchang/annie-personal-projects/blob/main/data-analysis/Employee%20Attrition%20Analysis.ipynb)

   In this project, I integrated SQL queries and Python code within a Jupyter notebook environment to explore a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Leveraging SQLAlchemy and Pandas, I connected to a MySQL database and conducted exploratory data analysis. Through Matplotlib, I   
   visualized key insights, empowering HR teams to make informed decisions regarding employee retention strategies.


**Python Projects:**
1. Breakout Game: [Breakout Project Code](path/to/breakout.py) | [Breakout Graphics Project Code](path/to/breakout_graphics.py)

   The breakout game is a classic arcade game implemented in Python, featuring interactive gameplay where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.

2. [Baby Names](https://github.com/anniecnchang/annie-personal-projects/blob/main/python-programming/babygraphics.py)

   The Baby Name Ranking Project presents a dynamic display of baby name popularity over the years.

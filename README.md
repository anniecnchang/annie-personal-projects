**Data Analysis:**

1. [Employee Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/anniecnchang/annie-personal-projects/blob/main/data-analysis/Employee%20Attrition%20Analysis.ipynb)

   In this project, I integrated SQL queries and Python code within a Jupyter notebook environment to explore a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Leveraging SQLAlchemy and Pandas, I connected to a MySQL database and conducted exploratory data analysis and utilized Matplotlib      to visualiz key insights. Furthermore, I've conducted hypothesis testing to assess the statistical significance of observed differences, enabling HR teams to make informed decisions regarding employee retention strategies based on reliable and accurate data.

3. [Emergency 911 Calls Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/anniecnchang/annie-personal-projects/blob/main/data-analysis/Emergency%20911%20Calls%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

   In this project, I utilized python to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the emergency 911 calls in PA from 2015 to 2020. By analyzing these calls, I aim to identify patterns and trends in emergencies, enabling emergency response agencies to 
   optimize resource allocation and improve response times, ultimately enhancing public safety and emergency preparedness in the region.

**Python Programming:**
1. Breakout Game: [Breakout Project Code](https://github.com/anniecnchang/annie-personal-projects/blob/main/python-programming/breakout.py) | [Breakout Graphics Project Code](https://github.com/anniecnchang/annie-personal-projects/blob/main/python-programming/breakoutgraphics.py)

   The breakout game is a classic arcade game implemented in Python, featuring interactive gameplay where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.
